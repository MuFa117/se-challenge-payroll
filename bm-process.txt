Concerns:
	- date of half month
	- last day of the month (to show)
	- max file size (although, .csv are pretty small)

Questions:
	- can user be in both groups. 

Etaps:
	API:
		- receive csv file
			- check size, check format (header + footer)
			- check report ID
			- upload as temporary file
			- parse csv file and save to database data
				- save report ID as well for crosscheck
		- get report data
	CONFIG file:
		- A, B 
		- database user / password / database name
	SETUP file:
		- user config database
	APP:
		- upload file and report table available on one page

Notes:
	- make one insert instead of line by line (whole csv insert)

FAQ:
- Why pays are calculated on server
	* Because those are set from the 'employer' level, so it shouldn't be on the client side


What can be improved:
	- server side validation for file format and format size
	- add table 'reports' to track uploaded reportID's (right now it's tracked just from table hours)
	- login / authentication
	- TAG Coding messages from server to front
	- when employee will do other job group task (change of query required, to separate job groups)
	- consider uploading multiple files
